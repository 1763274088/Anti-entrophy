# The 1st Conference

## Group divisions

### AI group

The great majority of its task is ***Computer Vision***, in which we will focus on (moving(drone) & static(obstacle)) ***object recognitions***, vision based ***SLAM*** (including dynamic SLAM (optical flow)), and gesture readings(optional)**.** And some NLP, and Human-computer interaction design. \[TX2 Jetson]

### Software group

Tasks include ***Communication*** ***Network System*** (network among drones and video feeds to a pad), ***Data Analysis***, ***Android Application***, ***Linux Application***, and ***custom GUI tools***. Most of the applications are meant to help other groups. \[Raspeberry Pi\]

### Flight Controller group

Topics include ARM ***Embedded Systems***, ***Sensors*** (physics of sensors; usage protocols; sensor integration and selection), Noise filtration, ***Control algorithms***, ***Dynamics Modeling***, ***Real-Time Dispatching***. [Pixhawk v2 + STM32 Nucleo F446]

### Electronic Hardware group

More diverse tasks including ***Embedded Systems, PCB analysis & design & soldering, Camera and other sensors,*** and ***E-Hardware Testing Environment.***

### Mechanical Hardware group

3D CAD design, Hardware-Assembly, Material Analysis



## Meeting plans for summer

-   Doing work over the summer is not mandatory, but highly encouraged, (take time until finished final to make a decision on whether to work or not, give team member sign-up sheet to select **July, August, September,** minimum 1 of the 3 months if decide to work, workload will be impacted!!!) If choose not to work over the summer, let us know, and be prepared to take extra work when fall 2018 starts

-   Meeting for group-leads with the team-lead will be weekly, online, and one-on-one -- slack/facebook/skype/Wechat or QQ. Dates can be flexible. The meeting with team-lead will be mainly about reporting group status, technical discussion, planning and assigning works, and scheduling the next deadline. And this online meeting is not intended to be longer than 1 hour.

-   Each group-lead is not bounded by the way he wants to arrange his internal meeting with his group-mates, as long as he can get everyone on track, updated, and working.

-   Purchasing parts?

-   Project Space is open when team-lead is there.



## General Policy

-   Estimated number of people in our team is 22, 5 open spaces for each group other than M-Hardware which only has 2 open spaces. So estimated 10 from this year and another 12 from the incoming year.

-   Someone who enrolls more than 4 classes in a quarter, or getting involved in more than 2 extracurricular projects/student org, will count as Â½ person in the above calculation.

-   Everyone must participate in at least one of the groups

-   Everyone must participate in weekly group meetings **and** dedicate time on the task on which he agrees working, unless there is a valid excuse **and** the corresponding group-lead gets notified early. Someone who has two unexcused absence or not doing the responsible work for two weeks will be automatically dropped from our team to give space for other dedicated people.

-   There will be deadlines, and penalty for not making the deadlines. Failing to meet the deadlines is always tolerated without any major penalty if it is due to technical issues or issues beyond your control, having too much homework is **not** one of them. Each individual is responsible to plan and negotiate the deadline tasks and dates to ensure he is capable of meeting the deadline, in other words, there is some flexibility into it. Groups and individuals who fail to meet the deadlines **without** valid excuses (valid excuses include tolerated situation above) for more than 3 times will be investigated by Team-lead to determine whether the responsible individual(s) will continue to stay in the team or not.



## Assignments Due July 8

-   AI group:

    -   CV: Square Ranging techniques, on computer

    -   Find a AI related math topic (Eg: Linear Algebra, probability, optimization, etc), briefly study them and summarize them in an informal report.

    -   Find a textbook/tutorial site/online lesson on the computer vision of our interests, study the first chapter, and summarize them in that report as well

-   Software group:

    -   Continue working on RTSP android app, have testing run by the deadline

    -   Find study material on RTSP protocol in detailed, not just API, and we are interested in bidirectional communications to build a complete network among our drones, alternate protocols are also accepted.

    -   Exploring making GUI on Linux, prepare a demo on something simple

-   Flight controller group:

    -   Setting up Pixhawk environment

    -   Learn coding stm32, and prepare GPIO, USART, ADC demos

    -   Read and summarize half of the book *Rigid Body Dynamics*

-   E-Hardware group:

    -   CAD prototype

    -   Energy consumption, lift weight, and rotory system power analysis and prediction

    -   Help and get involved in flight controller group

-   M-Hardware group:

    -   Recruit MAE people
